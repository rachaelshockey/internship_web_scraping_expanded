# internship_web_scraping_expanded
## Final Project for DAT-129 (Python II) - Analysis of Indeed.com data collected with BeautifulSoup

### Abstract

This program uses Python's `requests`, `pandas`, `csv`, `time`, and `BeautifulSoup` modules to scrape a simple search for U.S. internships on the popular job search engine, Indeed.com. The program exports this data to csv files, then imports them back into Python as a `pandas` dataframe in order to analyze current trends in internship compensation, geographic locations, and industries. 

### Purpose & Inquiry Question

For this project, I set out to look at a snapshot of internship listings (posted within the last week of April 2021) on the popular job search engine Indeed.com. I was interested in exploring the following questions:

* What percentage of internship opportunities currently listed on Indeed are paid positions?
* Among the paid internship opportunities on Indeed, what are the pay rates like?
* Geographically, where are paid internships concentrated?
* Are certain industries more likely to pay their interns than others?

I hypothesized (before reading the 2016 report from NACE) that only about 20% of internship postings would be paid opportunities, that most paid opportunities would offer around $15 per hour, that paid opportunities would be concentrated in urban areas with high costs of living (NYC, the Bay Area, Chicago, and D.C), and that most of the paid opportunities would be in the fields of web development/engineering and finance. I backed away from the industry-related inquiry after realizing that, in this time of social distancing, it appears that the industries hiring interns right now are mostly ones where remote work is possible. For example, Indeed's Hiring Lab recently reported that [the percentage all marketing internships that offer remote work jumped from 14.3\% to 45.3\% during the pandemic](https://www.hiringlab.org/2021/04/27/remote-internships-jump-during-pandemic/).
