# internship_web_scraping_expanded
## Final Project for DAT-129 (Python II) - Analysis of Indeed.com data collected with BeautifulSoup

### Abstract

This program uses Python's `requests`, `pandas`, `csv`, `time`, and `BeautifulSoup` modules to scrape a simple search for U.S. internships on the popular job search engine, Indeed.com. The program exports this data to csv files, then imports them back into Python as a `pandas` dataframe in order to analyze current trends in internship compensation, geographic locations, and industries.
